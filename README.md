# castlefalkenstein-vtt

The Castle Falkenstein system for FoundryVTT

Since Foundry VTT is currently lacking a system to support card decks, this 
is more of a playground for me, but perhaps it might be useful to some. 

Currently includes:

* Skill list sorted by card suit
* Initiative based on perception skill
* Placeholder for card slots (wip)
