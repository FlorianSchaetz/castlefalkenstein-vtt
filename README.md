# castlefalkenstein-vtt

A Castle Falkenstein system for Foundry VTT

Since Foundry VTT is currently lacking a system to support card decks, this is more of a playground for me, but perhaps it might be useful to some. 

Currently includes:

+ Skill list sorted by card suit
+ Initiative based on perception skill
+ First attempts of building a card system (work in progress, will likely be replaced as soon as the official card system is there)

To Do (next steps):

+ Nicer Character sheet (for example adding a (editable) title, so that you can have "The adventures of..." or "The Diary of..." on top)
+ Dealing cards to players dialog
+ Checkboxes at cards, so that players can check cards and then do a skill check
+ Better skill list (only show skills that are not AV (average), allow to set others from list - should be much nicer and shorter)

The base files of this system were created with Asacolips' generator-foundry:
